```python
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4

def calculate_series(terms):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(terms):
        # Calculate the current term
        current_term = (-1) ** n / (2 * n + 1)
        total += current_term
    
    # Multiply the total by 4
    total *= 4
    return total

result = calculate_series(10000)
